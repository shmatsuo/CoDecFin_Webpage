<h3 id="pageSubtitled">Background</h3>
<p>On June 8th and 9th 2019, Distributed Ledger Technology-related innovations have been referenced in the Communique at the G20 Finance and Central Bank Meeting in Fukuoka, Japan, referencing the report produced by <a href="https://fsb.org/about" target="_blank">the Financial Stability Board (FSB).</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://mof.go.jp/english/international_policy/convention/g20/communique.htm?fbclid=IwAR2gyy7LFqed1L4L8M-71KRnIUFtpgj3yArNfZzuD1CqbdaUy57r6Fy4J9Q" target="_blank">G20 Communique</a> Section 13 "We welcome the FSB report on decentralized financial technologies, and the possible implications for financial stability, regulation and governance, and how regulators can enhance the dialogue with a wider group of stakeholders.”</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://fsb.org/2019/06/decentralised-financial-technologies-report-on-financial-stability-regulatory-and-governance-implications" target="_blank">FSB Report</a> Decentralised financial technologies: Report on financial stability, regulatory and governance implications; <a href="https://fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P060619.pdf" target="_blank">Direct link to the FSB Report document</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://bgin-global.org/" target="_blank">Blockchain Governance Initiative Network ("BGIN" - pronounced ‘BEGIN’)</a> ​was initiated on March 10, 2020 after several multi-stakeholder workshops including CoDeFi 2020, an associated workshop with Financial Cryptography 2020. BGIN is a multi-stakeholder discussion network which aims at providing an open and neutral sphere for all stakeholders to deepen common understanding and to collaborate to address issues they face in order to attain sustainable development of the blockchain community.</p>


<h3 id="workshop-on-coordination-of-decentralized-finance-codecfin">Workshop on Coordination of Decentralized Finance (CoDecFin)</h3>
<p>This workshop is designed to identify and discuss technology and operation issues of permissionless blockchain and decentralized finance. As permissionless blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms evolve and mature, there is an urgent need for multi-stakeholders to engage in their planning, development, roll-out, and operation, in order for innovation of a wide variety of financial applications to proliferate and become mainstream. Thus far it has been mainly developer &amp; startup communities which are driving these protocols, platforms, and applications for this new era of computing. New ​standards, governance mechanisms and design patterns​are evolving and need input from a variety of perspectives. There is a growing trend towards decentralized computing systems in which distributed ledger technologies are a fundamental component. These systems are designed to be global computing systems; they will likely form the basis of new financial services and businesses including a distributed Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI). These new financial services and businesses could bring huge benefit to the global financial system, e.g. resiliency over efficiency, and predictability over resiliency. However financial regulators, central banks, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), while recognizing the potential of DLT systems, have also been keenly aware of the challenges in the adoption, and designing for the consumer protections required to balance usability, safety while supporting innovation. While it is likely that many G20 countries will be leading the design and development of these new infrastructures, all cities and countries ​should be considered and encouraged to participate​in the planning. </p>
<p>Discussions of this workshop are expected to contribute to discussions of Blockchain Governance Initiative Network (BGIN), where common documents on blockchain technology and operations are created backed by all stakeholders.</p>
<!--
<p>In 2020, chairs of CoDecFin and Workshop on Trusted Smart Contract (WTSC) identified that
    both FC workshops have common interests. In 2022, if both workshops are approved to be
    held, it is possible to hold a joint session to discuss multidisciplinary issues of smart contracts by
    attendees of both workshops.</p>

<h3 id="pageSubtitle">Special area of this year</h3>
Though the areas of academic discussion of this workshop are widely open (see <a href="./cfp.html" target="_blank">  the call for paper</a>), from ongoing discussions among stakeholders, we strongly encourage to submit academic papers/research results to provide academic foundation to all stakeholders for following areas.
<ul>
<li> AML/KYC, Privacy Protection, and Privacy Pool</li>
<li> Privacy Impact by Digital Assets and Identity Mechanism</li>
<li> harmonization of CBDC, Deposit Token, Stable Coin and DeFi</li>
<li> Points of Failure of Stable Coins</li>
<li> Smart Contract Security and Governance </li>
<li> Wallet and Governance </li>
<li> Cyber security framework for blockchain ecosystem</li>
<li> Transparency of on-chain analysis</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u><font color="Tomato">Note: This workshop does not endorse any specific decentralized finance projects and products.</font></u></strong></p>

<h3 id="pageSubtitle">Basic Structure of the Workshop</h3>
<p>This workshop is composed of two parts:
</p><li>Presentations of academic and practical results on blockchain technology and operations</li>
<li>A joint invited talk and round table with WTSC </li>
<li>A Roundtable on the emerging governance topic toward standardization</li><p></p>

<p>
<br>This preliminary information is subject to change.
</p>
  <!-- START CONTENT
  <p></p><h2 id="pageSubtitle">Schedule (tentative and subject to change)</h2>

  <br>The workshop will be divided into three main sections:
  <br>- Presentations of academic and practical results on blockchain technology and
  operations
  <br>- Selected talks from a variety of stakeholders
  <br>- Unconference style multi-stakeholder discussions on selected discussion topics<br><p></p>

  <p>9:00 Introductions &amp; Overview
  <br>9:05 Session 1: Blockchain technology issues (80 minutes)
  <br>10:25: Break (20m)
  <br>10:45 Session 2: Blockchain operational issues (80 minutes)
  <br>12:05 Lunch (60m)
  <br>13:00 Joint Session with other workshop (1 hour 45 minutes)
  <br>14:45 Break (15 minutes)
  <br>15:00 Talks from stakeholders: Regulators, Engineers and Business (50 min)
  <br>16:00 Round table
  <br>17:00 Summaries from each table and Wrap up<br></p>

  <p></p><h3 id="pageSubtitle">Round table roles (6-8 persons per table)</h3>
  Ideally, each table would have representation from each of these areas. During registration,
  participants will identify their role: Regulator, Banker / Financial Services, Lawyer, Economist,
  Technologist, Business, Academic / Research Scientist/ undefined. Either the table moderator,
  or assigned scribe to summarize key points, and questions asked. <p></p>

  <p></p><h4 id="pageSubtitle">Examples of Roundtable discussion questions</h4>
  Roundtable discussions may include the following questions - e.g. one question per table:
<ul>
  <li>Potential of decentralized finance</li>
  <ul>
    <li>How may blockchain tech transform securities and derivatives markets? (see:
  The Promise of Blockchain Technology for Global Securities and Derivatives
  Markets: The New Financial Ecosystem and the 'Holy Grail' of Systemic Risk
  Containment</li>
    <li>What current day institutions are likely to disappear if they do not adapt?</li>
    <li>How may the new trading markets evolve e.g. stock markets, using DLTs? Tzero
  vs Linq vs ASX</li>
    <li>How may new decentralized online markets impact KYC/AML regulations?
  OpenBazaar, Origin</li>
  </ul>

  be focused on harmonizing standards e.g. ISO, NIST, Enterprise Ethereum
